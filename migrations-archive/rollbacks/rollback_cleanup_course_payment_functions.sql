-- Rollback for cleanup_course_payment_functions.sql
-- Date: 2025-07-02
-- Description: This rollback is empty because the cleanup operation removed redundant functions
-- and we don't want to restore these redundant functions.
-- Note: If you need to restore a specific function that was accidentally removed,
-- you would need to consult the database backups or original migration that created it.
-- This rollback script is intentionally empty as restoring redundant functions
-- would likely cause more confusion and potential issues.
