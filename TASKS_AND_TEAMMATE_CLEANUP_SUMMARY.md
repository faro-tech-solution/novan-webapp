- `app/admin/tasks-management/page.tsx`
- `src/pages/management/TasksManagement.tsx`
- `app/teammate/` (entire directory)
- `src/pages/dashboard/TeammatesDashboard.tsx`
- `src/pages/shared/TeammateTasks.tsx`

### 2. **Components Removed**
- `src/components/dashboard/DailyTasksCard.tsx`

### 3. **Database Migrations Removed**
- `migrations/rls/05_tasks_rls.sql`

### 4. **Navigation & Routing Cleanup**
- Removed teammate navigation items from `DashboardLayout.tsx`
- Removed tasks management card from `AdminDashboard.tsx`
- Removed teammate routes from `App.tsx`
- Removed task management route from `App.tsx`
- Removed teammate and task imports from `src/pages/management/index.ts`

### 5. **Authentication & Role Cleanup**
- Removed `teammate` role from `UserRole` type in `AuthContext.tsx`
- Removed teammate role references from `UserManagement.tsx`
- Removed teammate panel data from `DashboardPanelContext.tsx`

### 6. **Translation Cleanup**
- Removed `tasksManagement` and `myTasks` translations from `src/utils/translations.ts`
- Removed `teammate` role translation from `src/utils/translations.ts`

### 7. **Documentation Updates**
- Updated `migrations/database_schema.md` to remove task management section
- Removed task and teammate references from RLS policies documentation
- Removed task system from migration history

## 🗄️ Database Cleanup Script Created
Created `migrations/cleanup_tasks_and_teammate.sql` with the following operations:
- Drop `subtasks` table
- Drop `tasks` table
- Remove task-related RLS policies
- Remove task-related triggers
- Remove task-related functions
- Update existing teammate users to trainee role

## 📋 Database Tables to be Removed
The following tables will be removed when the cleanup script is executed:
- `tasks` - Main task table
- `subtasks` - Subtask table for task breakdown

## 🔄 Role Migration
- Existing users with `teammate` role will be automatically converted to `trainee` role
- This ensures no users lose access to the system

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Before Running Database Cleanup
1. **Backup your database** before running the cleanup script
2. **Verify no critical data** is stored in task tables
3. **Test in development environment** first
4. **Review teammate users** and ensure they should be converted to trainees

### Manual Database Cleanup
To remove task tables from your database, run:
```sql
-- Apply the cleanup script
\i migrations/cleanup_tasks_and_teammate.sql
```

### Verification Steps
After cleanup, verify:
1. ✅ No task-related pages are accessible
2. ✅ No teammate-related pages are accessible
3. ✅ No task or teammate navigation links exist
4. ✅ No task or teammate components are imported
5. ✅ No task or teammate database queries are executed
6. ✅ Application builds and runs without errors
7. ✅ Existing teammate users can still access the system as trainees

## 🎯 Result
The application now has a cleaner codebase without the task management and teammate functionality, reducing complexity and maintenance overhead while maintaining all other features intact.

## 📝 Remaining Tasks (Optional)
- Run the database cleanup script in your environment
- Update any deployment scripts if they reference task or teammate functionality
- Remove any task or teammate-related environment variables if they exist
- Update any external documentation or user guides

## 🔍 What Was Preserved
- All other user roles (trainer, trainee, admin)
- All other functionality (exercises, courses, wiki, accounting, etc.)
- User management (without teammate role)
- Daily activities management (separate from task management)
