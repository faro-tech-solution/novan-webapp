## üóÑÔ∏è Database Cleanup Script Created
Created `migrations/cleanup_groups.sql` with the following operations:
- Drop `group_courses` table
- Drop `group_members` table  
- Drop `groups` table
- Remove group-related RLS policies
- Remove group-related triggers
- Remove group-related functions

## üìã Database Tables to be Removed
The following tables will be removed when the cleanup script is executed:
- `groups` - Main group table
- `group_members` - Junction table for group membership
- `group_courses` - Junction table for group-course assignments

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Before Running Database Cleanup
1. **Backup your database** before running the cleanup script
2. **Verify no critical data** is stored in group tables
3. **Test in development environment** first

### Manual Database Cleanup
To remove group tables from your database, run:
```sql
-- Apply the cleanup script
\i migrations/cleanup_groups.sql
```

### Verification Steps
After cleanup, verify:
1. ‚úÖ No group-related pages are accessible
2. ‚úÖ No group-related navigation links exist
3. ‚úÖ No group-related components are imported
4. ‚úÖ No group-related database queries are executed
5. ‚úÖ Application builds and runs without errors

## üéØ Result
The application now has a cleaner codebase without the group management functionality, reducing complexity and maintenance overhead while maintaining all other features intact.

## üìù Remaining Tasks (Optional)
- Run the database cleanup script in your environment
- Update any deployment scripts if they reference group functionality
- Remove any group-related environment variables if they exist
